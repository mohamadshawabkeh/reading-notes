## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?**

RBAC is like assigning different roles in a theater production. It's a way to manage who can do what in a system or application. Each role has specific abilities and limitations, just like actors in a play have different roles.

**Example of RBAC with CRUD Operations:**

Imagine an online bookstore:

- **Role: Customer**
  - Create (add) a book to a wishlist.
  - Read (view) book descriptions and prices.
  - Update (change) your account information.
  - Delete (remove) a book from your wishlist.

- **Role: Admin**
  - Create new book listings.
  - Read all customer data.
  - Update book details or customer accounts.
  - Delete customer accounts or outdated book listings.

**Benefits of RBAC:**

- Enhanced security by limiting access to only what's necessary.
- Simplifies user management, especially in large systems.
- Easily adapts to organizational changes.
