## State Structuring Principles

When designing the state structure for your React application, consider the following five principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth:** Keep the application's state in a single location, usually at the top-level component or using state management libraries. This ensures consistent and predictable state management.

2. **Immutability:** Avoid directly modifying the state. Instead, create new instances of state when changes are needed. This helps prevent unexpected side effects and simplifies tracking changes.

3. **Top-Down Data Flow:** Pass the state down as props from parent components to child components. This helps in understanding the flow of data and makes the application more maintainable.

4. **Component Hierarchy:** Design a component hierarchy that reflects the structure of your application's UI. Place the state in the appropriate components to ensure a clear relationship between data and UI.

5. **Isolate State Logic:** Separate the logic that updates the state from the UI components. This can be achieved by using functions or hooks to modify the state, keeping the UI components focused on rendering.

## Problem Solved by Contexts

**Contexts** in React aim to solve the problem of **prop drilling**. Prop drilling occurs when you need to pass props through multiple layers of components, even if some intermediate components don't directly use those props. Contexts provide a way to share data without explicitly passing it through every component in the hierarchy.

## Alternative Technique to `useContext`

Before using the `useContext` hook, you can try using **prop drilling** or **component composition**. Prop drilling involves passing props through intermediate components, while component composition involves creating higher-order components that inject the required props.

## Complementary Hook for Complex Applications

For complex applications where managing state becomes challenging, the **useReducer** hook complements the `useContext` hook. `useReducer` is a more advanced alternative to `useState` and can be used to manage more complex state transitions in a more organized manner.
