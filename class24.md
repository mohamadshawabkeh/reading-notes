# Hash Tables Implementation

## Why Hash Tables?

Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are a powerful data structure used to store and retrieve data quickly. They provide constant time complexity for inserting, deleting, and retrieving values, making them ideal for scenarios where fast data access is crucial. Hash tables are particularly effective for tasks like caching, indexing, and managing associations between key-value pairs.

## What is a Hash Table?

A hash table is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values based on a key. It works by using a hash function to convert the key into an index in an array, where the corresponding value is stored. This enables efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions.

## How Hash Tables Work

1. **Hash Function**: A hash function takes a key as input and produces a fixed-size hash code. This hash code is used to determine the index in the array where the value will be stored.

2. **Array**: Hash tables use an array to store values. The array size is often chosen based on the expected number of elements to be stored. Each index in the array corresponds to a "bucket" where a value can be stored.

3. **Collision Handling**: Since multiple keys might produce the same hash code (collision), hash tables implement collision handling strategies to manage this. Common strategies include chaining (each bucket contains a linked list of values) and open addressing (if a bucket is occupied, find the next available bucket).

4. **Operations**:
   - **Insertion**: Compute the hash code for the key, determine the index, and store the value in the corresponding bucket.
   - **Retrieval**: Compute the hash code for the key, find the index, and retrieve the value from the bucket.
   - **Deletion**: Compute the hash code for the key, find the index, and remove the value from the bucket.

## JavaScript Implementation

Here's a basic implementation of a hash table in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Example usage
const hashTable = new HashTable();
hashTable.insert("name", "John");
hashTable.insert("age", 30);
console.log(hashTable.get("name")); // Output: John
console.log(hashTable.get("age"));  // Output: 30
```
