# Implementation: Graphs

## Why

**Q: Why is this implementation necessary?**

A: This implementation is necessary because graphs are fundamental data structures used to model relationships and connections between entities. They find applications in various domains, making it crucial for developers to have a comprehensive understanding of graphs and their operations.

## What

**Q: What does this implementation include?**

A: This JavaScript implementation includes the following components:

### 1. Graph Representation

- **Adjacency Matrix**: A matrix to represent the edges between vertices.
- **Adjacency List**: A list-based representation where each vertex maintains a list of its neighbors.
- **Edge List**: A list of all edges in the graph.

### 2. Common Graph Algorithms

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverse the graph using a stack to explore as deep as possible before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverse the graph level by level using a queue.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Including Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Implementations of Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.

### 3. Graph Operations

- **Adding and Removing Vertices and Edges**: Methods to modify the graph structure.
- **Graph Traversal**: Functions for visiting all vertices in the graph.
- **Cycle Detection**: Check whether the graph contains cycles.
- **Topological Sorting**: For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
- **Connectivity Analysis**: Determine if the graph is connected or find connected components.

## How

**Q: How can I use this implementation?**

A: To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Include the necessary JavaScript modules in your project.

3. Create a graph instance:

   ```javascript
   const Graph = require('./graph'); // Import the graph module

   // Create an undirected graph
   const graph = new Graph();

   // Add vertices
   graph.addVertex("A");
   graph.addVertex("B");
   graph.addVertex("C");

   // Add edges
   graph.addEdge("A", "B");
   graph.addEdge("B", "C");
