## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

Ans: its a function to put between main contributers, that runs in the middle of route 

2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.

Ans: framework for Node

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

Ans: it's means that it provides developers with the freedom to make their own architectural and coding choices without enforcing strict guidelines.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

Ans:A module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality, and modularity is useful to developers because it promotes code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.


## What is NPM?

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

Ans: 9.5.0

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

Ans: npm i jshint


## What is TDD?

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

Ans: Tests are important because they provide assurance that our code functions correctly, preventing bugs and giving us confidence in the reliability of our software.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing

Ans:
- Testing helps identify and catch bugs early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later.

- Testing provides documentation and examples of how the code should be used, making it easier for other developers to understand and collaborate on the project.
- Testing allows for code refactoring and changes with confidence, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact and preventing regressions.

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

Ans:
- Individual pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests :

    A. Focusing only on positive scenarios and neglecting edge cases or error conditions can lead to incomplete test coverage and potential issues going unnoticed.

    B.Test code duplication

- Team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests: 

    A. Lack of communication and collaboration

    B.Test flakiness

## CI/CD

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
     
 Ans:
     A.Continuous Integration helps catch integration issues early by regularly merging code changes into a shared repository, enabling rapid identification and resolution of conflicts and compatibility problems.

     B.It enhances collaboration and reduces integration headaches by promoting a shared codebase where developers can continuously integrate their work, minimizing the risk of divergent code paths.

     C.Continuous Integration improves code quality and stability by automatically running tests and code analysis during the integration process, ensuring that only reliable and tested code is added to the project.

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

Ans: Continuous Delivery is the practice of continuously preparing software for release, while Continuous Deployment takes it a step further by automatically deploying the software to production environments after passing the necessary tests and quality checks.

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background


Ans :GitHub is a web-based platform that facilitates version control and collaboration, enabling developers to store and manage their code repositories, track changes, and seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for efficient software development and deployment.

## Reflection
 #### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

Ans: learning about Express Server Mechanics: Routing, Middleware, and Approaches to Testing and how to apply them on my server, using for middleware and how to add it in my route and some of it use.
Also learning some features from testing and how to test my routes in the server.
