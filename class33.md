# Redux Toolkit (RTK)

### What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit addresses several concerns in Redux development:

1. **Boilerplate Code**: RTK reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to set up and manage Redux stores.

2. **Immutability**: It encourages the use of immutable data structures through utilities like `immer`, making it easier to update state in a predictable manner.

3. **Reducers**: RTK provides `createSlice()` to simplify the creation of reducer functions, making them easier to read and maintain.

4. **Async Actions**: It includes an `createAsyncThunk` utility for handling asynchronous actions in a consistent and efficient way.

5. **DevTools Integration**: Redux DevTools Extension integration is set up by default, simplifying debugging.

6. **Configuration**: It offers a `configureStore()` function that provides a default setup for Redux stores, including middleware and dev tools.

### What does configureStore() do?

`configureStore()` is a function provided by Redux Toolkit to set up a Redux store with a default configuration. It combines several pieces of Redux configuration into a single, simple function call. Here's what it does:

- Sets up the Redux store with a reducer, middleware, and other options.
- Configures middleware like Redux Thunk for handling asynchronous actions.
- Enables Redux DevTools Extension integration for easier debugging.
- Provides a convenient way to create the Redux store.

## How to Use `createSlice()`

### How would I use createSlice()?

`createSlice()` is a function in Redux Toolkit that simplifies the creation of Redux slices. A Redux slice typically consists of a reducer and a set of actions related to a specific part of your application state.

Here's how you would use `createSlice()`:

1. Import `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit:

   ```javascript
   import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

2. Define the initial state for your slice:
const initialState = {
  // Initial state 
};

3. Create a slice using createSlice():

 const mySlice = createSlice({
  name: 'mySliceName', // A unique name for your slice
  initialState, // The initial state for this slice
  reducers: {
    // Define your reducer functions and actions here
  },
});

4. Export the reducer and actions:

export const { reducer } = mySlice;
export const { action1, action2 } = mySlice;

## MobX FAQ

```markdown
### What is Mobx?

MobX is a state management library for JavaScript and React applications. It provides a simple and reactive way to manage the state of your application. MobX stands for "observable" and "reactive," reflecting its core concepts.

### How does MobX make it "impossible" to produce an inconsistent state?

MobX ensures the consistency of application state by automatically tracking dependencies between observable data and reactions. When any observable data changes, MobX automatically triggers updates to any reactions (like UI components) that depend on that data. This ensures that the state is always consistent because changes to data are immediately reflected in related parts of the application.

### How would we build a reactive user interface?

To build a reactive user interface with MobX, follow these steps:

1. **Define Observables**: Identify the pieces of your application state that need to be observed for changes. These become MobX observables.

2. **Create Reactions**: Define reactions, such as UI components or functions, that depend on observables. MobX will automatically track these dependencies.

3. **Modify State**: When you need to change the state, do so through MobX observables. MobX will propagate the changes to dependent reactions.

4. **React to Changes**: Your UI components will automatically re-render or execute based on the changes to observables, providing a reactive user interface.
