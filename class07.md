## Intro to JWT

1. What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
   - JWT is a compact and self-contained token format for securely transmitting information.

2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens?
   - JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs.

3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?
   - Claims are expected in the payload component of a JWT.

## Are JWTs Secure?

1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?
   - Decoding the payload of a JWT does not compromise its security.

2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.
   - Both the sender and receiver must know the shared secret appended in the signature.

3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
   - Concatenated content and the secret should not be sent directly to a non-technical recruiter.
