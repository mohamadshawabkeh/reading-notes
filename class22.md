# `useEffect` Hook

The `useEffect` hook in React is designed to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, DOM manipulation, subscriptions, or any other operation that doesn't directly affect the rendering of the component. It allows you to perform these actions after the component has rendered, and also handle cleanup when the component is unmounted or when specific dependencies change.

## Intended Use Case
The main intended use case for the `useEffect` hook is to manage side effects that need to occur in response to changes in a component's state or props. It provides a way to perform asynchronous operations or interact with the external world without blocking the rendering process.

## Interaction with the Component
The effect's logic interacts with the component in the following way:
1. **Mounting**: When the component is initially rendered, the effect is executed after the component has been added to the DOM.
2. **Updates**: If the component's state or props that are listed as dependencies in the effect change, the effect is re-executed after the component re-renders.
3. **Unmounting**: If the component is about to be removed from the DOM, the effect's cleanup function (if provided) is executed, allowing you to clean up any resources or subscriptions.

## Importance of the Return Value
The return value from the effect's logic function is crucial for performing cleanup and preventing memory leaks. This return value should be a function that undoes the operations performed by the effect, such as unsubscribing from subscriptions or clearing intervals. This cleanup function is automatically invoked by React when the component is unmounted or before the effect is re-executed on subsequent renders.
