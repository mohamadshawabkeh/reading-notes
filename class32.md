# Readings: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## async actions

1. **Why use Redux middleware?**
   - Redux middleware is used to handle asynchronous actions, such as API calls, in a Redux application. It allows you to perform side effects and asynchronous operations before the action reaches the reducer, ensuring that the data flow remains predictable and consistent.

2. **Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.**
   - In the Redux Async Data Flow, when an async action is dispatched, it typically involves three stages: 
     - The action is first dispatched, typically with a type and payload.
     - Middleware, like Redux Thunk, intercepts this action, and if it's a function (thunk), it invokes it.
     - Inside the thunk function, asynchronous operations, such as API requests, are performed, and new actions are dispatched based on the results. These new actions can be success or failure actions.
     - Finally, the new action (success or failure) reaches the reducers, which update the application state accordingly.

3. **How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?**
   - We can accommodate async in a Redux app by using middleware like Redux Thunk. Redux Thunk allows us to write action creators that return functions instead of plain action objects. These functions can contain asynchronous logic, such as API calls, and dispatch further actions based on the results of these async operations.

## thunk middleware

4. **Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?**
   - You would need `redux-thunk` middleware to handle asynchronous operations, like making API requests or delaying dispatching an action, within your Redux action creators. It provides a way to write action creators that can dispatch multiple actions asynchronously.

5. **Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.**
   - Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a **function** instead of an action. This function can perform asynchronous operations and dispatch actions when those operations are completed.

6. **Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.**
   - The return value from the inner thunk function will not be automatically made available to the rest of the application. However, you can use the `dispatch` function provided by Redux to dispatch actions from within the thunk function, and those actions can carry data or results of the asynchronous operation. These dispatched actions can then be handled by the reducers to update the Redux store as needed.
