### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
One of the more important things to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the efficiency of the operations required for the problem at hand.

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
To avoid an infinite recursive call stack in data structures and algorithms, we need to ensure that the recursion has a well-defined base case and the problem size decreases with each recursive call, leading to termination.
