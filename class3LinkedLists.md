# Linked Lists

## Overview
A linked list is a fundamental data structure used for organizing and storing elements. It consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list. This README provides an overview of linked lists, including their types, advantages, common operations, and considerations.

## Definition
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

## Types of Linked Lists
### Singly Linked List
A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node has data and a reference to the next node. The last node points to null.

## Advantages
- Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink without requiring contiguous memory allocation.
- Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Inserting or deleting nodes in a linked list is efficient, as it involves updating a few references.
- Flexibility: Linked lists can handle different data types and variable-length elements.

## Operations
1. Insertion: Adding a new node at a specific position or at the beginning or end of the list.
2. Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
3. Searching: Finding a specific value in the list.
4. Concatenation: Combining two linked lists together.

## Example Code Snippet

```javascript
// Node class definition
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

// Linked List class definition
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }
}

  // Insertion at the end
  append(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = newNode;
    } else {
      let currentnode = this.head;
      while (currentnode.next !== null) {
        currentnode = currentnode.next;
      }
      currentnode.next = newNode;
      return this;
    }

  }



// Create a linked list and perform operations
const linkedList = new LinkedList();
linkedList.append(5);
linkedList.append(10);
linkedList.append(15);

```
